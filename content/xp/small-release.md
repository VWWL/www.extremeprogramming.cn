Make frequent small releases

The development team needs to release iterative versions of the system to the customers often. Some teams deploy new software into production every day. At the very least you will want to get new software into production every week or two. At the end of every iteration you will have tested, working, production ready software to demonstrate to your customers. The decision to put it into production is theirs.

The release planning meeting is used to plan small units of functionality that make good business sense and can be released into the customer's environment early in the project. This is critical to getting valuable feedback in time to have an impact on the system's development. The longer you wait to introduce an important feature to the system's users the less time you will have to fix it.
