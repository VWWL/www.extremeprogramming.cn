# CRC卡

以团队协作的方式使用CRC（即：Class - 类名、Responsibilities - 类的职责、Collaboration - 类的协作关系）卡来设计系统。CRC卡最大的价值是让人们摆脱程序化的思维模式，更充分地欣赏对象技术。CRC卡允许整个项目团队成员参与设计。能够帮助设计系统的人越多，好点子的数量就越多。

单个CRC卡用于表示对象。对象的类可以写在卡片的顶部，类的职责列在左边，协作类列在每个职责的右边。我们说“可以写”，是因为一旦CRC会话全面启动，参与者通常只需要一些带有类名的卡片，而实际上不需要完整地写出卡片。一个简短的例子作为咖啡机问题的一部分。

CRC会话通过讨论哪些对象向其他对象发送消息来模拟系统。通过逐步了解过程，很容易发现缺点和问题。通过模拟所提出的设计，可以快速探索设计方案。

如果你发现太多的人同时说话和移动卡片，那么就把站着和移动卡片的人数限制在两个人。当一个人坐下时，另一个人才能站起来。这对于失控的会话有奇效，这种失控的会话通常发生在当一个棘手的问题最终得到解决时，团队往往会变得吵闹。

对CRC卡最大的批评之一是缺乏书面设计。但这通常是不需要的，因为CRC卡使设计显而易见。如果需要更持久的记录，可以为每个类写一张完整的卡片，并作为文档保存。一个设计，一旦被想象成已经建成并运行，就会在人们的脑海中停留一段时间。


<!-- # CRC Cards
Use Class, Responsibilities, and Collaboration (CRC) Cards to design the system as a team. The biggest value of CRC cards is to allow people to break away from the procedural mode of thought and more fully appreciate object technology. CRC Cards allow entire project teams to contribute to the design. The more people who can help design the system the greater the number of good ideas incorporated.

Individual CRC Cards are used to represent objects. The class of the object can be written at the top of the card, responsibilities listed down the left side, collaborating classes are listed to the right of each responsibility. We say "can be written" because once a CRC session is in full swing participants usually only need a few cards with the class name and virtually no cards written out in full. A short example is shown as part of the coffee maker problem.

A CRC session proceeds with someone simulating the system by talking about which objects send messages to other objects. By stepping through the process weaknesses and problems are easily uncovered. Design alternatives can be explored quickly by simulating the design being proposed.

If you find too many people speaking and moving cards at once then simply limit the number of people standing and moving cards to two. When one person sits down another may stand up. This works for sessions that get out of hand, which often happens as teams become rowdy when a tough problem is finally solved.

One of the biggest criticisms of CRC Cards is the lack of written design. This is usually not needed as CRC Cards make the design seem obvious. Should a more permanent record be required, one card for each class can be written out in full and retained as documentation. A design, once envisioned as if it were already built and running, stays with a person for some time.
