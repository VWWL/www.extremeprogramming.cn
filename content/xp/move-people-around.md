# 人员流动

让人员流动起来，可以避免严重的知识孤岛和信息丢失。如果团队中某块领域的工作只有一个人能做，那么当这个人离开项目或者肩负了太多工作时，项目的进度就将大为拖延。

为了避免这种知识孤岛，很多公司都愿意让团队成员之间进行“交叉培训”。然而，通过培训得来的知识仍然很容易流失。而让团队成员流动到代码库的不同领域，辅以结对编程的实践，则

> Cross training is often an important consideration in companies trying to avoid islands of knowledge, which are so susceptible to loss. Moving people around the code base in combination with pair programming does your cross training for you. Instead of one person who knows everything about a given section of code, everyone on the team knows much of the code in each section.
 
 A team is much more flexible if everyone knows enough about every part of the system to work on it. Instead of having a few people overloaded with work while other team members have little to do, the whole team can be productive. Any number of developers can be assigned to the hottest part of the system. Flexible load balancing of this type is a manager's dream come true.	
 
 Simply encourage everyone to try working on a new section of the system at least part of each iteration. Pair programming makes it possible without losing productivity and ensures continuity of thought. One person from a pair can be swapped out while the other continues with a new partner if desired.
