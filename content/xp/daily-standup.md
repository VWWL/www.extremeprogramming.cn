At a typical project meeting most attendees do not contribute, but attend just to hear the outcome. A large amount of developer time is wasted to gain a trivial amount of communication. Having many people attend every meeting drains resources from the project and also creates a scheduling nightmare.
在传统的项目会议上，大多数参会者参会只是为了听取结果而非贡献。为了获得（这样的）大量沟通浪费了大量开发人员时间。让很多人参与每次会议消耗项目资源，同时也会产生日程安排的噩梦。

Communication among the entire team is the purpose of the stand up meeting. A stand up meeting every morning is used to communicate problems, solutions, and promote team focus. Everyone stands up in a circle to avoid long discussions. It is more efficient to have one short meeting that every one is required to attend than many meetings with a few developers each.
整个团队之间的沟通是站立会议的目的。每天早上的站立会议用于沟通问题、解决方案并促使团队关注。每个人围成一圈，以避免长距离讨论。要求每个人都参加的一次简短会议比少数开发人员各自举行的多次会议更有效率。

When you have daily stand up meetings any other meeting's attendance can be based on who will actually be needed and will contribute. Now it is possible to avoid even scheduling most meetings. With limited attendance most meetings can take place spontaneously in front of a computer, where code can be browsed and ideas actually tried out.
当您每天举行会议时，任何其他会议的出席都可以基于实际需要的人员和会员。现在，甚至可以避免安排大多数会议。由于参加人数有限，大多数会议都可以在电脑前自发进行，在那里可以浏览代码并实际尝试想法。

During a stand up meeting developers report at least three things; what was accomplished yesterday, what will be attempted today, and what problems are causing delays. The daily stand up meeting is not another meeting to waste people's time. It will replace many other meetings giving a net savings several times its own length.
在一次站立会议期间，开发人员至少报告三件事：昨天完成了什么，今天将尝试什么，以及导致延误的问题。每日站立会议不是又一浪费人们时间的会议。它将取代许多其他会议，净节省数倍时间于其（会议时间）长度。
